Kitty the cat loves her cat nip. Every morning Kitty wakes up to a bowl of food and a little pile of cat nip on the side. 
She eats her breakfast as she watches her owner leave for work, 
looking forward to when her owner will come back home at the end of the day. 
But one morning, there was no cat nip, and her owner was no where to be found.
Kitty felts so disappointed that she decided not to watch her owner leave for work.
She went back to her tiny cat nest and fell asleep immediately.
However, for this time, she did not have a sweet dream. She had a nightmare...
