Kitty the cat loves her cat nip. Every morning Kitty wakes up to a bowl of food and a little pile of cat nip on the side. 
She eats her breakfast as she watches her owner leave for work, 
looking forward to when her owner will come back home at the end of the day. 
But one morning, there was no cat nip, and her owner was no where to be found.
Kitty felts so disappointed that she decided not to watch her owner leave for work.
She went back to her tiny cat nest and fell asleep immediately.
However, for this time, she did not have a sweet dream. She had a nightmare...
In her dream, she saw a large dog, an unfamiliar dog overcast in shadows.
Then she saw a her owner standing next to that dog. 
Then everything started spinning, faster and faster, until she felt like she was being swept into a vortex.
Kitty woke up, and something wasn't right anymore..
She was in her house, but nothing felt familiar.
She coudln't figure out what happened. Kitty was very scared. Kitty looks down and she notices something. She has no paws! She has no idea whats going on and gets really scared. She just wants to go home and enjoy some more catnip with her owner.
